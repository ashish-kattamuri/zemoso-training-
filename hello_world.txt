Ashish Ashishok an example of an SCM system requiring thirty seconds Ashish apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale Ashish the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at a time. He wanted patching Ashish take three seconds,[6] and had several other design criteria in mind: take Concurrent Versions System
